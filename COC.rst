Code of Conduct
===============

Preamble
--------

OBS is made up of many people from all over the world, with different
backgrounds and experiences that they bring to the project. In order to
continue letting the community grow, feel safe, and to encourage good
communication, we are adopting the following Code of Conduct. This
document—or any subsequent version—will be enforced from July 31st, 2021
onwards.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies to anyone who contributes—or wishes to
contribute—to the project directly, is taking part in community
discussion in official channels, or are in a position where they’ll be
seen as a representative of the project, regardless of whether they
intend to speak for the project or not.

A person is considered to be representing the project if they’re
speaking as a code contributor, support volunteer, member involved with
the project, or if they have some kind of visible role in an official
channel for OBS. This does not include roles for Sponsors or Patrons.

Official channels for OBS include the Discord server, the forum, any
GitHub repositories within the OBS Project organization, any social
media accounts for OBS Project, any public events where OBS Project has
a presence, any presentations given on behalf of OBS Project, or any
other situation that can be reasonably interpreted as being hosted,
attended or communicated by the OBS Project.

This Code of Conduct is subject to change, and any changes will have a 2
week notice period before taking immediate effect. Changes will not be
enforced retroactively unless it directly affects the security, safety
or well-being of another individual, or other exceptional circumstances.

Guidelines
----------

General
~~~~~~~

-  We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
   environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender
   identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal
   appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality,
   or other similar characteristic.
-  Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that
   might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
   all.
-  Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude.
-  Respect that people will have differences of opinion.
-  We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
   anyone. That is not welcome behavior. The definition of harassment is
   provided in the section on Unacceptable Behavior. In particular, we
   don’t tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized
   groups. This includes private harassment.
-  Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other
   attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.
-  Being a recognized Contributor, Support Volunteer, Sponsor or Patron
   does not give you special right to avoid following these guidelines
   when taking part in community discussions.

Code Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Respect that every design or implementation choice carries a
   trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
-  Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid
   ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
-  Do not post negative or inflammatory comments on code submissions. If
   you believe that a code submission has problems, provide constructive
   or actionable feedback, or a reason for why a submission is being
   rejected. Where it is possible, provide explanations that someone can
   use to fix things.

Support Volunteers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  There are many users of differing skill levels or abilities. This is
   never a reason to refuse support for someone, as long as it’s within
   the scope of OBS support, and the user is willing to cooperate.
-  Just because something seems obvious to you, doesn’t mean it’s
   actually obvious. If someone is having difficulty understanding how
   to use OBS, it should never be treated as their fault.
-  Bad advice is often worse than no advice. If you don’t know how to
   address someone’s issue, then get ahold of someone who’ll be able to
   provide them help. We can only expect so much patience from a user
   asking for support, and helping without understanding the problem
   only results in using up that patience.

Unacceptable Behavior
---------------------

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable
within our community:

-  Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against
   another person.
-  Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise
   discriminatory jokes and language.
-  Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
-  Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying
   information ("doxing").
-  Personal insults.
-  Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or
   jokes, and unwelcome sexual advances.
-  Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following.
-  Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

Enforcement
-----------

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting an
enforcement team member at one of the following addresses:
coc@obsproject.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated,
and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate
to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further
details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

In other cases where behavior is against the general guidelines set out
in this Code of Conduct, this may be brought up with a moderator through
either a Discord DM, or through an email to an enforcement member. In
these cases, it is always assumed in the first instance that a person
means well, and action will only be taken in the case of repeated
failure to follow the guidelines.

Feedback
--------

Suggestions for changes can be made by submitting a pull request on the
`obsproject/obs-studio <https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio>`__
repo, or if you wish to privately discuss your concerns, you can instead
email coc@obsproject.com.
