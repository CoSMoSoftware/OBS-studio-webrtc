/**
 * @file restclient.cpp
 * @brief implementation of the restclient class
 *
 * This just provides static wrappers around the Connection class REST
 * methods. However since I didn't want to have to pull in a whole URI parsing
 * library just now, the Connection constructor is passed an empty string and
 * the full URL is passed to the REST methods. All those methods to is
 * concatenate them anyways. So this should do for now.
