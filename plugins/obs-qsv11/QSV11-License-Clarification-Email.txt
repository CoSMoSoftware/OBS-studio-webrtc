Dear Seung-Woo,
I've been interested in using and extending OBS.  In browsing the
source code I found your excellent contribution [1].  Given that I use
OBS with Intel QSV on a daily basis, I was wondering if the comments
in the headers such as "INTEL CORPORATION PROPRIETARY INFORMATION" and
the reference to the non-disclosure agreement were included in error?

Hi Aidan,



Yes, I work with OBS and have contributed a few changes (user cmlin2) in the last year. I think your question is more about the code that Seung-Woo contributed, correct?



Seung-Woo, was the QSV contribution you made still under NDA?



Thanks,

Christine

Aidan,



This is a legal question. Christine is finding the right contact to address the matter.



Regards,

Seung-Woo

Hi Aidan,



We got through to Legal and it looks like the NDA clause that Seung-Woo added 5 years ago to the code he added to OBS doesn’t apply to open source code once it’s been accepted by the community. You can remove it for your modifications.



Thanks,

Christine
